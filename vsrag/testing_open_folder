This is the dummy response from LLM.

Sure! Here's an example of a simple Python code that calculates the sum of two numbers:

```python
# Input the two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Print the result
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
```

This code prompts the user to enter two numbers, calculates their sum, and then prints the result.

Sure, here's an example of Python code that generates a Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(num):
    fib_seq = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, num):
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[i-1] + fib_seq[i-2])
    return fib_seq

n = 10
fibonacci_sequence = fibonacci(n)
print(fibonacci_sequence)
```

This code defines a function `fibonacci` that takes a number `num` as input and returns a list of the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. It then calls the `fibonacci` function with `n = 10` and prints the resulting sequence. You can adjust the value of `n` to generate a larger or smaller sequence.

Sure, here is an example of simple Python code:

```
# This program prints "Hello, World!" to the console
print("Hello, World!")
```

Is there anything specific you would like the code to do?To rotate a vector in 2D, you can use the following Python code:

```python
import math

def rotate_vector(vector, angle):
    x = vector[0]
    y = vector[1]
    
    # Convert angle from degrees to radians
    angle_radians = math.radians(angle)
    
    # Calculate new x and y coordinates after rotation
    new_x = x * math.cos(angle_radians) - y * math.sin(angle_radians)
    new_y = x * math.sin(angle_radians) + y * math.cos(angle_radians)
    
    return [new_x, new_y]
```

You can call the `rotate_vector` function by passing in the vector and the desired angle of rotation. The function will return a new vector with the rotated coordinates.
